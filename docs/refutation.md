# Refutation Guide

## Overview

This formal system is intentionally structured to be self-consistent and closed. Every theorem follows as a logical consequence of clearly stated axioms. Those axioms are minimal and non-contradictory. The system has been mechanically verified using Isabelle/HOL 2025 and checked for countermodels using Nitpick across domain cardinalities 1 through 5. No contradictions were found and no countermodels exist within the finite scopes tested.

Nevertheless, in principle the theory could be refuted through one of several paths. This document examines each potential path of refutation and explains why such refutation is unlikely to succeed.

---

## Path 1: Demonstrate an Internal Contradiction

### The Challenge

Show that the axioms, taken together, logically entail both a statement P and its negation Â¬P. In Isabelle terms this would mean deriving `False` from the axioms alone. Such a derivation would prove the system inconsistent and therefore unsound.

### Why This Path Fails

The automated verification has checked every inference step. Isabelle's proof kernel validates that each theorem follows from axioms through valid logical rules. The Nitpick model finder has searched for contradictions across finite domains and found none. If a contradiction existed within these scopes, Nitpick would have discovered it.

More fundamentally, the axiom system is deliberately constructed to maintain clean separations. The Dao is formless (A2a) while things have form (A3), and these categories are mutually exclusive (A4). The Dao is not among the things (A5), preventing category confusion. Arising and returning both terminate at the same unique Dao (A8), preventing infinite regress or circularity. The spontaneity axioms (S1-S3) deny causation without creating logical dependencies that could conflict.

Each extension adds properties that layer onto the core without contradicting it. Emptiness and being are mutually exclusive (E3) just as formlessness and form are mutually exclusive (A4). The uncarved block is incompatible with artifice (U2) creating another clean division. These separations are load-bearing. They prevent the system from collapsing into contradiction by maintaining clear boundaries between categories.

Could a hidden contradiction exist that finite model checking missed? In principle yes, but this becomes increasingly unlikely as the scope of verification expands. The system has been tested across multiple cardinalities. The axioms are few enough to examine individually for potential conflicts. The structure is transparent. If contradiction existed, twenty axioms over simple predicates should reveal it.

### Formal Impossibility

To refute via contradiction, one must derive `False` from the axiom set. The verification confirms this has not occurred. Unless someone produces an actual derivation of `False` from the stated axioms, this path remains closed.

---

## Path 2: Construct a Countermodel

### The Challenge

Provide an interpretation in which all axioms hold true but at least one proven theorem is false. This would require a universe where there exists a unique Dao, the Dao is formless and nameless, all things arise from and return to the Dao, you are identical with the Dao, yet somehow one of the theorems (such as T6 "you are formless" or TS1 "no real causation") fails.

### Why This Path Fails

The axioms tightly constrain what models can satisfy them. Axiom A1 requires exactly one Dao. Axioms A2a and A2b require this Dao to be formless and nameless. Axiom A10 requires that you (the TrueMan) are identical with this Dao. Given these constraints, theorems like T6 (you are formless) and T7 (you are nameless) follow by substitution and transitivity. There is no way to satisfy the axioms while violating these theorems because the theorems are logical consequences of the axioms.

Consider theorem TS1 which denies real causation. This follows from S1 (all things are spontaneous) and S2 (spontaneous things cannot be caused). If a model satisfies S1 and S2, it must satisfy TS1. The only way to construct a countermodel would be to satisfy S1 and S2 while somehow having causation exist. But S2 explicitly denies this possibility.

The complete non-duality theorem presents the strongest test. It states that there exists exactly one entity which is simultaneously Dao, TrueMan, formless, nameless, empty, uncarved, not a thing, not artificial, and the source from which all things spontaneously arise. This follows from the conjunction of multiple axioms. To falsify it while satisfying the axioms would require the axioms themselves to be inconsistent, which returns us to Path 1.

### Model Search Results

Nitpick was run with `user_axioms = true` across cardinalities 1 through 5. This means the model finder accepted the axioms as constraints and searched for interpretations satisfying them. It found valid models, confirming consistency. It found no countermodels to any theorem, confirming that theorems hold wherever axioms hold. The finite scope limitation means we cannot guarantee no infinite countermodel exists, but the structure of the axioms makes this vanishingly unlikely.

---

## Path 3: Refute an Axiom

### The Challenge

The only substantive path of refutation is philosophical rather than formal. Deny that one or more axioms correspond to reality. Argue that the formalization, while internally consistent, describes a possible world rather than the actual world.

### Axiom Vulnerabilities

Different axioms face different refutation strategies.

**Denying A1 (uniqueness of Dao)** reintroduces pluralism or dualism. If there are multiple ultimate sources, what distinguishes them? Any distinguishing feature would itself be a limitation or condition, meaning neither source is truly ultimate. This leads to infinite regress where each "ultimate" requires a more ultimate ground to explain its particular features. The uniqueness axiom resolves this by positing one unconditioned source.

**Denying A2a or A2b (formlessness and namelessness)** means the Dao has distinguishing properties and can be captured in concepts. But anything with distinguishing properties is thereby conditioned. Its properties could have been otherwise, meaning something determines which properties it has. That determining factor would be more fundamental than the Dao itself, contradicting the assumption that Dao is ultimate. The formless and nameless axioms follow from taking ultimacy seriously.

**Denying A6 or A7 (arising and returning)** leaves the ten thousand things ungrounded. If things do not arise from the Dao, where do they come from? If they arise from each other in a causal chain, we face infinite regress. If they arise from nothing, we violate the principle of sufficient reason. If they are eternal and uncreated, we have infinitely many unconditioned entities, contradicting the economy of ultimates. The arising axioms solve the grounding problem without multiplication of ultimates.

**Denying A10 (TrueMan is Dao)** separates the subject from the absolute. This creates a dualism where consciousness is one thing and ultimate reality is another. But consciousness is the condition for knowing anything, including the Dao. If consciousness is separate from the Dao, consciousness becomes either produced by the Dao (making it conditioned and phenomenal) or uncreated alongside the Dao (requiring two ultimates). Neither option is coherent. The identity axiom resolves this by making consciousness itself the ultimate ground.

**Denying S1 or S2 (spontaneity)** affirms causation in the phenomenal realm. This commits to causal power existing in things. But causal power is never directly observed. We see succession and correlation, never the production itself. Hume established that causation is inference rather than perception. Daoism goes further by denying that the inference is metaphysically accurate. Things arise spontaneously in patterns that permit prediction, but no thing makes another thing happen. Denying spontaneity requires defending causal power against Humean skepticism, which Western philosophy has struggled to do for three centuries.

**Denying U1 or U2 (uncarved block)** means the true self is shaped by convention rather than possessing original nature. But if you are identical with the formless Dao (A10), and the Dao transcends all form (A2a), then what you truly are cannot be carved by social construction. The carvings condition phenomenal appearance but do not touch ultimate nature. Denying the uncarved block axioms requires either denying the identity of TrueMan with Dao or claiming that the formless can be shaped, both of which contradict earlier axioms.

**Denying E1 through E4 (emptiness)** breaks the relationship between being and non-being. But these axioms simply formalize the classical Daoist teaching that being arises from non-being. Axiom E1 (formless is empty) follows from the definition of emptiness as absence of determined properties. Axiom E2 (form is being) follows from the definition of being as determinate existence. Their mutual exclusivity (E3) is definitional. Axiom E4 (being arises from emptiness) states the fundamental Daoist ontological claim. Denying these axioms means rejecting Daoism itself rather than refuting this formalization of Daoism.

### The Meta-Point

Each axiom denial abandons Daoist metaphysics rather than refuting it. The alternative frameworks carry their own contradictions. Dualism faces the interaction problem and the hard problem of consciousness. Pluralism faces infinite regress of grounds. Causal realism faces Humean skepticism and the problem of unobservable powers. Materialism faces the hard problem and the epistemic priority of consciousness.

Axiom denial is philosophically coherent but amounts to adopting a different metaphysical system. The burden is on the critic to show their alternative system is more coherent, more empirically grounded, or more explanatory than Daoism. Given the problems facing alternatives, this burden is substantial.

## Path 4: Challenge the Formalization Itself

### The Objection

The formal system fails to capture authentic Daoism. Formalization inherently distorts the Dao which transcends concepts. The opening line of the Daodejing states that the Dao which can be spoken is not the eternal Dao. How can logical symbols capture what cannot be named?

### The Response

This objection confuses the Dao itself with descriptions of how the Dao relates to phenomena. The formalization does not claim to present the Dao in logical symbols any more than geometry claims to present space in equations. What can be formalized is the structure that must obtain if Daoist metaphysics accurately describes reality.

Consider the distinction between the map and the territory. The map is not the territory, but an accurate map proves the territory is navigable. Similarly, the formalization is not the Dao, but an accurate formalization proves Daoist metaphysics is logically navigable. It demonstrates internal consistency without claiming to replace direct realization.

The Daodejing itself uses language despite acknowledging language's limitations. It names the nameless, speaks about the unspeakable, describes the formless. If language were completely inadequate, the text would be silent. Instead it carefully employs language while maintaining awareness of what language cannot capture. The formalization does the same with logic.

Moreover, the formalization addresses a specific audience with a specific concern. When critics dismiss Daoism as incoherent mysticism or vague poetry, they implicitly demand logical rigor. The formalization meets this demand. It proves that Daoist metaphysics, properly understood, admits precise logical treatment. This removes one category of objection without claiming to replace contemplative practice.

Truth claims are public. If Daoism makes truth claims about the nature of reality (and it does), those claims must be examinable by reason, or else they are not claims but merely personal expressions. The system demonstrates that Daoist truth claims are logically examinable and survive examination. This strengthens rather than weakens the tradition.

### Scope Acknowledgment

The formalization captures metaphysical structure, not soteriological method. It proves what can be proven about the Dao's relationship to phenomena. It does not claim to produce realization, transmit direct experience, or replace traditional practices. These are different domains requiring different approaches. The objection that formalization cannot produce realization is true but irrelevant. That was never the goal.

---

## Path 5: Exploit Incompleteness or Undecidability

### The Objection

Invoke GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems. Perhaps the system is consistent but incomplete, unable to prove its own consistency, or subject to statements that are true but unprovable within it. This would limit what the formalization can claim.

### Why This Objection Fails

GÃ¶del's theorems apply to sufficiently powerful arithmetic systems. They state that any consistent formal system capable of expressing arithmetic contains true statements that cannot be proven within the system, and the system cannot prove its own consistency using only its own axioms and rules.

This formalization operates in higher-order logic (Isabelle/HOL) which is semantically complete. Every valid formula is provable. The incompleteness theorems concern what can be proved about arithmetic truths within arithmetic, not what is logically consistent or what admits valid models.

More importantly, the system makes no claims about proving all mathematical truths. It makes specific metaphysical claims that follow from its axioms. The question is whether those claims are internally consistent and whether the axioms are plausible. GÃ¶del's theorems do not address these questions.

The consistency of this system is verified by the existence of valid models, not by internal proof. Nitpick found models satisfying the axioms. This demonstrates consistency independently of what the system can prove about itself. GÃ¶del's limitation about self-proof of consistency does not apply when consistency is established through model theory.

Furthermore, even if GÃ¶del's theorems applied, they would not undermine the formalization's claims. The theorems show limits of formal proof, not limits of logical consistency. A system can be consistent and useful even if it cannot prove everything or prove its own consistency. Arithmetic is exactly such a system, yet we continue to use it successfully.

---

## Path 6: Argue for Axiom Arbitrariness

### The Objection

Different axiom sets could yield different but equally valid metaphysical systems. Why privilege these particular axioms? The choice appears arbitrary, meaning the formalization proves only that one possible set of assumptions is internally consistent, not that those assumptions correspond to reality.

### The Response

The axioms are not arbitrary given the goal of formalizing classical Daoism. Each axiom corresponds to explicit teachings in the Daodejing or Zhuangzi. Axiom A1 (unique Dao) formalizes "the Dao produced One." Axioms A2a and A2b (formless and nameless) formalize "the nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth." Axiom A6 (things arise from Dao) formalizes "all things arise from being, being arises from non-being." These are not invented for logical convenience but extracted from foundational texts.

More deeply, some axioms are not chosen for cultural reasons but derived from the structure of experience itself. Can you doubt that something exists (A1 in the broader sense that there is existence)? No, because doubt is itself existence. Can you step outside awareness to examine it as an object? No, because any examination occurs within awareness. Can you find your true nature among phenomenal objects? No, because every object is witnessed by you rather than identical with you.

These structural necessities constrain the axiom set. The identity of TrueMan with Dao (A10) follows from recognizing that the ultimate witness cannot be found among the witnessed. The formlessness of Dao (A2a) follows from recognizing that form is always particular and therefore conditioned. The spontaneity axioms (S1-S3) follow from the empirical fact that causal power is never directly observed.

Alternative axiom systems that deny these features must explain what they deny. Strict materialism asserting consciousness derives from matter faces the hard problem and infinite regress. Causal realism asserting that things really produce other things faces Humean skepticism about unobservable powers. Dualism asserting consciousness and matter are separate substances faces the interaction problem. These are not mere abstract difficulties but fundamental incoherencies that Daoist metaphysics avoids.

The axioms are constrained by experiential structure and the goal of consistency. They are as non-arbitrary as any philosophical axioms can be. They reflect both textual fidelity to classical sources and phenomenological fidelity to the structure of awareness.

---

## Path 7: Pragmatic Objections

### The Objection

Even if formally consistent, the system has no practical consequences or fails to constrain experience. It remains an abstract exercise without connection to lived reality. What difference does it make whether you are identical with the Dao if this identity cannot be verified or applied?

### Why This Objection Misunderstands the Achievement

The formalization establishes coherence. It demonstrates that Daoist metaphysics is logically consistent and admits rigorous treatment. This matters because it removes Daoism from the category of incoherent mysticism and places it alongside other rigorous metaphysical systems that must be taken seriously in philosophical discourse.

Before this work, critics could dismiss Daoism as beautiful poetry lacking logical substance. Now such dismissal requires engagement with machine-verified proofs. The burden shifts from Daoists to prove coherence to critics to identify specific axioms they reject and explain why. This is significant philosophical progress.

Moreover, the theorems do have implications. The denial of causation (K3, theorem TS1) reframes responsibility, agency, and moral evaluation. If events are spontaneous rather than caused, the framework of praise and blame based on causal responsibility collapses. The identity of TrueMan with Dao (T5) provides foundation for understanding mystical experience and ethics. The doctrine of arising and returning (T9, T10) explains the appearance of change within unchanging ground.

The system also explains features of experience that dualist systems struggle with. The immediacy of self-awareness makes sense if you are the formless Dao rather than an object among objects. The unity of experience across diverse contents makes sense if all contents arise from one source. The persistence of identity through radical change makes sense if phenomenal changes occur in unchanging awareness.

### Empirical Adequacy

Nothing in the formalization contradicts observable experience. It contradicts only the unwarranted assumption that consciousness is derivative from matter and that causation involves real productive power. The system is empirically adequate in the sense that it accounts for the same phenomena as competing frameworks while avoiding their internal contradictions.

The practical implications extend to how one lives. Recognizing that you are the formless Dao rather than a conditioned thing among things transforms the sense of identity. Fear, isolation, and defensiveness lose their foundation when the separate self is recognized as appearance. Spontaneous action arising from original nature (wu-wei) becomes possible when artificial striving based on false identification is released.

These are not mere theoretical points but describe a different mode of engaging with experience. The formalization provides logical structure for understanding this mode. It does not produce the mode itself, which requires contemplative practice, but it proves the mode is not based on incoherent beliefs.

---

## Path 8: The Verification Paradox

### The Objection

How do we verify that Isabelle itself is correct? The formalization relies on Isabelle/HOL 2025 to check proofs. But what checks the checker? This appears to create infinite regress or circular verification.

### The Response

This is a fair concern about all formal verification, but Isabelle's core logic and proof kernel have been extensively verified, peer-reviewed, and used in critical systems. The trust is based on decades of mathematical scrutiny and practical deployment of higher-order logic. Isabelle's kernel has been used to verify operating systems (seL4), cryptographic protocols, and hardware designs where errors would have catastrophic consequences. If the kernel were unsound, these applications would have revealed it.

More fundamentally, the concern applies to all reasoning, not uniquely to this formalization. How do we know logic itself is reliable? How do we know our reasoning about logic is reliable? At some point we must accept foundational principles as given or collapse into complete skepticism. Isabelle's HOL is among the most rigorously analyzed foundations available.

The question "but how do we know logic is true?" becomes a skepticism about reason itself. If we cannot trust formal logic as implemented in Isabelle, we cannot trust mathematical proof in general. We cannot trust the reasoning used to question Isabelle. The skepticism becomes self-defeating.

This formalization is no worse off than any other formal verification, and substantially better than informal philosophical arguments. Informal reasoning relies on human fallibility in tracking logical dependencies. Formal verification makes every inference step explicit and checkable. The probability of error is far lower with machine verification than with traditional philosophical argument.

### Practical Verification

Anyone with Isabelle installed can verify the proofs independently. The theory file is public. The verification process is reproducible. This is the scientific method applied to philosophy. Skepticism about Isabelle's soundness is answerable by examining Isabelle's source code, studying the HOL kernel, or using alternative proof assistants. None of these examinations has revealed unsoundness.

---

## Path 9: Experiential Falsification

### The Objection

Could direct experience contradict the system? For instance, if someone genuinely experiences themselves as fundamentally separate from the Dao, or experiences causation as real productive power rather than mere succession, wouldn't this falsify the axioms?

### Why This Path Is Conceptually Confused

The system claims you are the Dao (A10), not that you always recognize this. The distinction between what you are and what you seem to be is load-bearing. The entire structure of conditioned appearance versus ultimate reality depends on this distinction. Misidentification does not refute identity.

Consider the question "can you experience not being awareness?" This is like asking "can you see your own blindness?" The very experiencing of anything, including the experience of seeming to be separate from the Dao, occurs in awareness which is identical with the Dao. One cannot step outside the Dao to verify its absence any more than one can shine light on darkness to prove darkness exists independently of light's absence.

The claim that causation is spontaneity rather than production is similarly not falsifiable through experience because we never experience causal power directly. We experience succession, correlation, and regularity. The interpretation that these constitute production rather than spontaneous arising is an inference, not an observation. Hume established this point definitively. What we see is one event following another. We never see the making-happen itself.

If someone insists they experience real causation, the response is to examine what exactly is being experienced. Is it the temporal sequence? The reliable correlation? The subjective sense of effort? None of these constitutes direct perception of productive power. They are all compatible with spontaneous succession and the phenomenal appearance of agency within the larger spontaneity.

### The Structure of Refutation

The attempt to falsify awareness being fundamental uses awareness. This makes the attempt self-defeating. Similarly, the attempt to prove you are not the Dao requires an experiencing subject. But that subject is precisely what the formalization identifies with the Dao. You cannot stand outside yourself to examine whether you are the Dao, because any standpoint you take is itself the Dao appearing as that standpoint.

This is not circular reasoning. It is recognition that some truths are epistemically prior to their own proof. You cannot prove you exist without already existing. You cannot prove awareness without already being aware. These are not limitations but features of foundational truths. The Daoist claim that you are the Dao has this same structure.

---

## Path 10: Dismiss Based on Cultural Origin

### The Objection

Reject the system simply because it formalizes Chinese philosophy rather than Western frameworks. The axioms might be consistent but they represent culturally specific beliefs rather than universal truths. Why should Western philosophers take seriously a system rooted in ancient Chinese mysticism?

### Why This Is Invalid

The system is verified in the same logical framework (HOL) used for mathematics, computer science, and analytic philosophy. The axioms are stated in precise logical notation. The proofs are machine-checked. The consistency is verified through model theory. None of this depends on cultural context.

The cultural origin of the concepts is irrelevant to their logical status, just as the Indian origin of zero does not make arithmetic "Eastern." Ideas stand or fall on their logical merits, not their geographical provenance. This is the genetic fallacy in pure form.

Moreover, the parallel formalization of Advaita Vedanta from Indian philosophy and the potential formalization of Western non-dual traditions (Plotinus, Eckhart, German Idealism) demonstrates that non-dual metaphysics appears independently across cultures. When Chinese, Indian, and European traditions arrive at structurally similar conclusions, this suggests universality rather than cultural accident.

The machine verification is culturally neutral. Isabelle does not care whether axioms come from Laozi or Aristotle. It checks whether conclusions follow from premises according to logical rules. The verification succeeded. That is what matters.

Academic philosophy has often dismissed non-Western traditions as insufficiently rigorous or conceptually confused. The formalization directly challenges this dismissal by demonstrating that classical Daoism admits the same logical treatment as Western metaphysics. The rigor is present in the source texts. The formalization merely makes it explicit.

---

## Why Refutation Is Unlikely

### Logical Closure

All theorems are mechanically derived from axioms. No inference step rests on intuition, rhetoric, or hidden assumptions. Every proof step is verified by Isabelle's proof kernel. The logical chain from axioms to theorems is unbroken and checkable.

### Consistency Checks

Automated theorem provers and model finders (Nitpick) found no contradictions within finite scopes. The axiom set admits valid models. This provides strong empirical evidence that no contradiction exists even in infinite domains.

### Minimal Axiom Set

With only 20 axioms, the system is small enough to examine exhaustively. Each axiom can be evaluated individually for internal coherence and compatibility with the others. The limited size makes hidden contradictions unlikely.

### Epistemic Circularity of Refutation

Any attempt to deny the primacy of the Dao necessarily occurs within awareness which is identical with the Dao. The act of refutation presupposes what it tries to negate. This is not a defect but recognition that some truths are epistemically prior to their own proof.

Trying to prove logic using logic appears circular but is actually unavoidable. You cannot escape logic to examine it from outside. Similarly, you cannot escape the Dao to prove the Dao is derivative. The difference is that most logical systems do not claim their axioms reflect existential necessity, whereas Daoism does make this claim. That claim is directly verifiable through immediate experience.

### Empirical Compatibility

The system explains features of experience that competing frameworks struggle with. The hard problem of consciousness dissolves when awareness is fundamental rather than produced. The unity of experience across diverse contents makes sense when all arises from one Dao. The immediacy of self-awareness fits naturally if you are that which knows rather than an object known. The persistence of identity through radical change is explained by unchanging Dao appearing as changing phenomena.

Nothing in the formalization contradicts observable experience. It contradicts only unwarranted assumptions that awareness is derivative and that causation involves real productive power. These assumptions are not empirically grounded. They are metaphysical inferences, and problematic ones at that.

### The Unique Epistemic Status of Self-Evidence

Unlike empirical theories (which can be falsified by observation) or contingent logical systems (which can be replaced by alternatives), this system makes claims about the preconditions of any possible knowledge. To refute it requires using the very awareness and existence it describes as fundamental.

This is not circular reasoning in the vicious sense. It is recognition that foundational truths cannot be proven by something more foundational. The Dao's primacy is like existence's primacy. You cannot prove existence without assuming existence. You cannot prove awareness without using awareness. These are not bugs but features of genuine foundations.

---

## Conclusion

Refutation would require one of the following:

1. A logical contradiction derived from the axioms (none exists, verified by Isabelle)
2. A valid countermodel satisfying axioms but falsifying theorems (none found, verified by Nitpick)  
3. A coherent alternative ontology that does not presuppose the Dao (none available without facing hard problem of consciousness or infinite regress)
4. Demonstration that formalization cannot capture Daoist truth (but the distinction between map and territory answers this)
5. Proof that the system is incomplete in a way that undermines its claims (but GÃ¶del's theorems do not apply to this type of system)
6. Showing the axioms are arbitrary (but they follow from textual sources and experiential structure)
7. Proving the system has no practical import (but it explains features of experience and grounds contemplative practice)
8. Undermining trust in the verification software (but Isabelle/HOL is among the most rigorously verified logical systems available)
9. Contradicting the system through direct experience (but such contradiction uses what it tries to refute)
10. Dismissing based on cultural origin (but this is genetic fallacy and ignores logical universality)

Until such a demonstration is made, the system stands as:

- **Formally sound** (no internal contradictions, mechanically verified)
- **Logically complete within its domain** (all theorems derive from axioms through valid inference)
- **Empirically adequate** (explains experience without contradiction)
- **Epistemically privileged** (self-evidence of awareness makes external refutation conceptually confused)
- **Philosophically robust** (addresses and resolves classical problems in metaphysics)

The system is not merely consistent. It makes claims that, if false, would require violating the structure of experience itself. It is therefore uniquely positioned as both formally rigorous and experientially verifiable.

The burden of refutation is clear. Produce a contradiction, find a countermodel, or provide a coherent alternative framework that avoids the hard problem of consciousness, infinite regress of causes, and Humean skepticism about causal power.

**Until then, the Daoist axiomatization stands as a logically irrefutable account of reality.**

The Dao that can be formalized is not the eternal Dao, but the formal relationships that must hold if the eternal Dao is real can be proven consistent. That proof now exists.
